# Git installation

Git is the *de facto* go-to solution for version control.

Go [**here**](http://git-scm.com/downloads) to download a graphical Git installer appropriate for your machine’s operating system (Mac / Windows).

Run the installer and follow its instructions to install the software. Usually the default options are all we need for configuring Git.

**Important Note for Windows Users**: after Git installation, please open your command-line terminal and run the following code:

**`git config --system core.longpaths true`**


# GitHub installation

GitHub is the leading online hosting service of Git repositories.

Go [**here**](http://github.com) to register an account if you have not got one.


# SourceTree installation

Atlassian’s SourceTree is one of the best desktop apps for managing Git repositories online and offline.

- Go [**here**](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com) to download a graphical installer of SourceTree appropriate for your machine’s operating system (Mac / Windows).
- Run the installer and follow its instructions to install the software into a folder you prefer.
- Launch SourceTree after installation, follow the default recommended basic configurations, and log in with your GitHub account.

**Important Note for Windows Users**: make sure SourceTree uses the "system" Git software (and _not_ its own "embedded" Git software), by:
 
- Installing Git as instructed above; and
- In SourceTree, adjust the following setting: go to _**Tools** > **Options** > **Git** > **Git Version**_  and select "**Use System Git**".


# Clone / Sync the Course GitHub Repository to local folder

## _Cloning_

- Open the SourceTree app
- Press "**Clone** / **New**" button; go to "**Clone Repository**" tab
- In "**Source Path** / **URL**", paste: <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>http://GitHub.com/ChicagoBoothML/MachineLearning_Fall2015</b></span>
- In "**Destination Path**", select a folder on your local disk drive you prefer
- Press "**Clone**" button

An exact copy of the course GitHub repository's content at the time of cloning
will then appear in the folder you specify.


## _Syncing_

Every now and then, when you want to make sure you have the latest updated materials:

- Open the SourceTree app
- Open the course repo by clicking on its name in the left-hand-side list of repositories
- With the repo open, press "**Pull**" at the top navigation bar

"Pull" will grab all the changes to the source GitHub repository _since your last clone / pull_,
and apply those changes to your local cloned copy, so that you'll end up with exactly the latest content. 


# _**Note**: GitHub connectivity restrictions by certain company internet networks_

In some rare circumstances, we have encountered company internet networks that block transactions with GitHub.com.

The recommended immediate quick fix is as follows:

- Leave your office early right now, beat the traffic, and arrive in your more GitHub-friendly home;
- Have a meal - _a proper big meal_ - to fuel your brain;
- Connect with GitHub with peace, and work on your ML homework _till sunbeams find you..._

Having said that, a company blocking GitHub can be symptomatic of some serious, deep-rooted problems;
reflect on the following possibilities:

- Your CTO may be ignorant;
- Worse, your CTO may be even evil;
- Your CEO may be ignorant of your CTO being ignorant or evil;
- Worse, it may be even the case that your CEO is evil;
- You yourself may be ignorant of your CEO and/or CTO being ignorant or evil...

If the GitHub issue helps you uncover such scares, leave your job, do a Machine Learning PhD,
and come back to boss the world! ;)
